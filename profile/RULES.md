## Rules

1. The content *must* be obscure at the time of posting.

This includes, but not limited to:
- If searched online, the phrase has no results, results that are not related, Qs but no As, unreliable As, or can be found at a random book (on Scribd, StuDocu, etc.) that takes time to find.
- Submissions that are paid (paywalled)

If the material posted is later found in the future, you may not delete it in any way.

2. An MD (Markdown) version must be provided.

This will help the material or the question become searchable in the future.

3. Unless stated otherwise, a DOC or DOCX (Microsoft Word document) version must be provided if it is an exam or a test.

Extremely useful for teachers. Markdown is incompatible with Word because of its portability feature.

**TBD for other rules, may be added over time.**
